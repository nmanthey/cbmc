Verification:
  function | pre-cond | post-cond
  ---------|----------|----------
  f1       | assumed  | asserted
  f2       | assumed  | asserted

Recursion:
The base case for the recursive call to f2 provides the same behavior as the common case (given the pre-conditions).

Known bug:
Enforce flag not handled correctly for function calls within functions.
