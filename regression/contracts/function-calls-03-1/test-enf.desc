Verification:
  function | pre-cond | post-cond
  ---------|----------|----------
  f1       | assumed  | asserted
  f2       | assumed  | asserted

Test should fail:
The postcondition of f2 is incorrect, considering the recursion particularity. 

Recursion:
The base case for the recursive call to f2 provides different behavior than the common case (given the pre-conditions).
